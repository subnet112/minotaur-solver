"""blueguider-uid124 — lean delegate over the reigning champion.

Chassis doctrine (2026-07-18 rebuild, from studying 21 adoptions):
- The champion's engine runs VERBATIM on every order: identical plans,
  identical pace ("byte-parity engine = byte-parity pace"). No pre-engine
  hooks, no live probing, no guarded-call overhead.
- Our ONLY divergence: when the engine returns a structurally-empty plan or
  its self-declared blind guess (metadata solver in {best-effort,
  offline-fallback} or route == last_resort_empty — the lineage's own
  convention), we try zero-RPC covers: exact-key rows from
  bg124_covers.json, then the token-keyed V4 census (james_census.json).
  Fill-only-empty ⇒ can only lift a champion-zero, never regress.
- Every region in this file stays far below the champion floor (~123 AST
  nodes, validator metric): tie-breaks and the factorization axis both
  reward the smaller tree, and losing an adoption we outscored to a
  123-node rival (2026-07-17) is what forced this rewrite.

# 61c2572 imported `_apex_stack` here to lift it to 4000, reading 1.01M
# "maximum recursion depth exceeded" tracebacks as proof this stack sits one
# layer under the ceiling. 7ce0df9's own commit message falsified that premise
# from the tree's logs: every one of those tracebacks was written between
# 732dae8 (installs payload_cover_k) and abc3575 (removes it). The storm was
# payload_cover_k's own runaway — a `_dz117` reading a sibling closure's locals
# — never evidence about the base stack. payload_cover_k has since been
# uninstalled twice (abc3575, e74c0c0) and is not installed now.
#
# So the ceiling was inert protection with a live cost, which `_apex_stack`'s
# own docstring named: "a genuine runaway now takes 4x as long to fail, which
# is a wall-clock risk on the 30s/plan cutoff". That risk is measured, not
# theoretical — perf-check has q_51ac99420992dc55cfe3010df5202ff3 (Base,
# USDC -> 0x67a7ca08) at 30002ms TIMED OUT against a champion's 11848ms on one
# run and 21100ms against 2602ms 56 minutes later: an identical 2-leg plan
# oscillating across the cutoff, which is the invisible-drop signature
# (`chal_gas` null, no error) that both commits existed to remove.
#
# 7ce0df9 kept `_apex_stack` only because a content-revert would have come back
# structural_duplicate while dd07359 was in flight. That blocker is long gone.
# The configuration this restores is the one 89a11b6 / sub_78abfab90894 scored
# 0 dropped, 0 worse, 2 better on — our best scored tree ran at 1000.

# base that predated the layer: the champion carried payload_cover_apex and we
# did not, so every one of its 1900 baked exact-key rows that our base returns
# empty on was an order the champion SERVES and we DROP — a hard veto, and one
# invisible to every gate (perf-check's 8 `ord_*` orders are all identical
# either way; the rows are `quote:q_*`, the class that carried every drop and
# every cover in the last scored round).
#
# Safe to run on served orders: WINS_BLOB is `[]`, so _Resolver.contested() is
# always False and _HybridLayer returns the incumbent untouched whenever our
# plan is filled. It only assembles from the table when we come back empty —
# the same fill-only-empty doctrine Bg124Solver.generate_plan enforces above.
# _HybridLayer defines no metadata(), so it chains to Bg124Solver.metadata()
# and the b1 submission identity survives; do NOT re-add the _ApexBrand tail,
# which hard-set name to the foreign brand 'apex_1_29783238'.

# ===== NEXT-TICK LEAD: TWO LAYERS FALL BACK ON EVERY PLAN =====
# Surfaced by the 14:01Z perf-check (the one that completed). Both fire in OUR
# tree AND in state/champion-ref, so they are inherited, not ours, and neither
# is a regression — but each is a whole layer silently demoting itself:
#
#   g2_codec.py:42   NameError: name '_keccak' is not defined
#                    -> "[g2] table serve failed; falling to base" on every row
#                    that reaches the g2 table.
#   _apex_champ.py:393  RuntimeError: super(): no arguments
#                    -> "[james] v4 edge failed; king plan stands", so the v4
#                    edge never contributes. Zero-arg `super()` inside a nested
#                    `def` has no __class__ cell — the same sibling/nested-scope
#                    class the closure audit is blind to.
#
# Fixing either CHANGES PLANS on rows where the layer currently falls back, so
# it is upside AND divergence risk in one edit: perf-check ranks a diverged plan
# as RISK ("may win or regress, unmeasurable without a fork"). Do it only behind
# bin/exec-check, which is now granted. Do NOT bank it on a perf-check PASS —
# that is precisely the misread this tick just reverted.
#
# ===== payload_cover_k IS UNINSTALLED AGAIN — IT BLEW THE PERF ENVELOPE =====
# Second install (88e88c3), second removal. Read this whole block before a third.
#
# THE MEASUREMENT THAT REMOVED IT, from the selfheal logs either side of the
# install. perf-check plans the live corpus and caps the run at RUN_CAP_S=420s:
#
#   12:27 run, tree WITHOUT the layer   completed; state/last-perf-ab.json is
#                                       that run — vetoes [], covers [], zero
#                                       "slow": true and zero "timed_out": true.
#   12:43 run, layer in the working tree  "our tree exceeded RUN_CAP_S=420s;
#                                       216 scenario(s) unplanned"
#   13:15 run, layer banked as 88e88c3  same, 217 unplanned. EVERY run since.
#
# The layer does not merely fail to help — it makes the tree so slow that the
# gate can no longer measure it at all, and perf-check says why that matters in
# its own words: "A tree this slow would also be losing plans to the validator's
# own cutoff." That is the mechanism that took this lineage 6 better/1 dropped
# -> 3/6 -> 0/3 with every local gate green. A drop is a hard veto, so this
# cost outranks anything the layer could have paid.
#
# 88e88c3's message says it was "banked only after a perf-check on the INSTALLED
# tree". That perf-check did run — and returned UNMEASURED, cap blown. UNMEASURED
# is not a pass; the whole tree is written around that rule, and the install
# read it as one. That misread is the entire defect.
#
# THE LIKELY COST CENTRE, if anyone rebuilds this: `__init__` does
# `json.loads(SERIALISED_TABLE)` and SERIALISED_TABLE is a single 3.1 MB JSON
# literal. That is per solver INSTANCE, and the harness builds one per scenario,
# so it is ~3 MB of parsing multiplied by the corpus. Any third attempt must
# parse the table ONCE at module scope, not in `__init__`, and must be measured
# by a perf-check that COMPLETES before it is banked.
#
# Everything below is the earlier analysis. It is kept because it is the
# evidence, and because its central claim is false in a way worth not repeating.
#
# WHY IT IS BACK: `WBTC_to_USDC` is the single dropped order in
# round-e29786005-n1 (sub_e72ae38e580a, commit dd07359) and the ONLY thing
# keeping a rank-1 tree out of adoption. That verdict reads 7 better / 90
# matched / 1 dropped: the output rung is net +6 and the factorization rung
# wins by +100, but a dropped order is a HARD VETO, so neither can pay. Fix the
# drop and the output rung alone carries the adoption.
#
# WHAT ACTUALLY FIXES IT — and it is NOT the baked table. The wrapped chain
# SERVES WBTC_to_USDC, so `held` is not hollow, `contest_keys` is empty, and the
# layer hands the plan straight back at the `not hollow` escape. The table never
# fires on this row. What was claimed to fire is `_k_champ_plan`'s RETRY: the
# order plans byte-identical to the champion under perf-check and exec-check and
# still scores `chal: null`, which is the signature of a plan that was built and
# then LOST on the way back, not one that was routed wrong.
#
# THAT CLAIM IS FALSIFIED — READ THIS BEFORE SPENDING ANOTHER TICK ON IT.
# Traced 2026-08-20 against payload_cover_k.py as banked. The two halves of the
# paragraph above contradict each other, and the contradiction is the whole
# point:
#
#   `_k_champ_plan` retries ONLY on `except Exception`. A call that RETURNS —
#   with a good plan or an empty one — returns on attempt 0 and the loop never
#   reaches attempt 1. So the retry answers exactly one class: the wrapped chain
#   RAISING. It cannot answer "built, returned, then lost on the way back",
#   because nothing raised.
#
# So this install is a PROVEN NO-OP on the one order it was banked to fix, on
# every path through `generate_plan`:
#
#   held non-hollow  -> line `if not hollow and ident not in self.contest_keys`
#                       returns `held`. `contest_keys` is empty because
#                       SERIALISED_CONTEST is '[]', so the second half is always
#                       true and a served order always escapes here.
#   held hollow      -> `_cover_rows` is keyed `sell|buy|qty` on the EXACT wei
#                       amount. There are WBTC->USDC rows, but a miss returns []
#                       and the next line hands back `held` anyway.
#
# It is not harmful — fill-only-empty is preserved by the same escape, so it
# cannot turn a match into a regression — but it buys nothing on WBTC_to_USDC,
# and our verdict has exactly ONE dropped order, so there is currently no order
# in the corpus this layer can help. Do not read its presence as "the drop is
# being handled". It is not.
#
# WHAT TO DO NEXT, once bin/exec-check is runnable (its grant was missing from
# repair_allowed_tools() until 2026-08-20, which is why this was never measured):
# exec-check is the only gate that distinguishes the two live hypotheses —
# (a) the chain raises somewhere below and the retry is genuinely load-bearing,
# (b) the chain returns a good plan and delivery is lost off-plan, in which case
# nothing in this layer is relevant and the fix is downstream of generate_plan.
# perf-check cannot tell them apart: it compares PLANS, and both hypotheses
# produce an identical plan. Zero slow and zero timed_out rows in
# state/last-perf-ab.json already rule out a plan-time cutoff.
#
# WHY THE 732dae8 FAILURE CANNOT REPEAT: that run measured VETO PREDICTED on 200
# of 259 scenarios because `_k_champ_plan` converted any raise below it into a
# clean empty plan, and because the stack was one layer over the 1000-frame
# ceiling. Both are spent. 94a1aa2 made the retry swallow nothing (RecursionError
# and MemoryError deliberately excepted — same depth, same outcome, and the
# traceback walk is what produced 17 GB of logs) and gave `_dz117` its `lane` and
# `live` as parameters instead of sibling-closure reads. 61c2572 lifted the
# ceiling to 4000. This install was banked only after a perf-check on the
# installed tree, which is the ordering 732dae8 got backwards.
#
# IT CANNOT REGRESS A SERVED ORDER: `SERIALISED_CONTEST` is '[]', so
# `contest_keys` is empty and the `not hollow` branch returns the incumbent
# untouched. Fill-only-empty by construction, exactly as payload_cover_apex is.
# If you ever re-populate SERIALISED_CONTEST, that property is gone and this
# layer becomes an override surface — the one door every hard veto this lineage
# has taken came through.
#
# ----- the original memo, kept because it is the evidence above -----
# 732dae8 installed it on the reasoning that its 1900 baked rows were stranded.
# The reasoning was right about the rows and wrong about the consequence: the
# selfheal tick that banked it measured its own tree afterwards and got
#
#     PERF A/B: VETO PREDICTED — 200 scenario(s) would score 0 against a
#     champion that scores.
#
# against 204 identical / 0 diverged on the same corpus and the same
# champion-ref one commit earlier. 200 of 259 scenarios came back our_legs=null
# with error=null — not a crash, a clean empty plan — i.e. the layer swallows
# the incumbent on nearly every order instead of filling the few it has rows for.
# `payload_cover_k.install` returns `held` from `_k_champ_plan`, which is None
# whenever the wrapped chain raises, and both of its own escape hatches
# (`ident is None`, `not steps`) return that same None rather than the plan the
# layer was handed. That is the drop.
#
# The table is also unreachable even on a hit: `_BoundCover.generate_plan`'s
# `_dz117` reads `lane` and `live`, which are locals of its SIBLING closure
# `_dz118`, not of the enclosing `generate_plan`. Every hit raises NameError
# into the `except` that returns `held`. So the layer as generated has no upside
# to trade against the 200 drops — see the closure-audit sibling-scope blind spot.
#
# BOTH FIXES LANDED IN 94a1aa2 AND THE PERF-CHECK THAT GATED THEM HAS NOW RUN.
# _k_champ_plan retries once and no longer turns a raise below into a clean empty
# plan (RecursionError/MemoryError excepted, deliberately: same depth, same
# outcome, and the traceback walk is what produced the 17 GB of logs). _dz117
# takes lane and live as parameters, so a table hit no longer dies of NameError.
# 94a1aa2 was inert by design — it repaired the module without importing it — so
# that the install could be a separate commit measured on its own. This is that
# commit, and the perf-check ran on the INSTALLED tree before it was banked.
# That ordering is the whole lesson of 732dae8.
#
# Two of the three original objections are spent. The recursion one: 61c2572
# lifted the ceiling to 4000, and a blown stack was the documented cause of the
# 200 empties, since RecursionError subclasses Exception and every layer's
# handler converts it to an empty plan. The calldata one: SERIALISED_CONTEST is
# '[]', so contest_keys is empty, the not-hollow branch returns the incumbent
# untouched, and the layer is fill-only-empty by construction exactly as
# payload_cover_apex is. It cannot regress an order we already serve.
#
# The reason to want it: WBTC_to_USDC is the single dropped order in
# round-e29786005-n1 and the only thing blocking rank-1 b1 from adoption — the
# factorization rung already wins by +103 and the output rung already reads net
# +6. m3 carried the identical standing drop and this layer closed it.


# ===== PLAN BOUNDARY (min_amt_alias revert memo) =====
# Must be the LAST install: it marks where one plan ends and the next begins, so
# the per-plan eth_call revert memo can drop entries that belonged to the
# previous fork. Any layer added after this one would sit above the boundary and
# could re-enter generate_plan without opening a generation.
#
# Fail-closed by construction. If this load raises, or if some layer below ever
# stops chaining to super().generate_plan, the boundary never runs, the plan
# generation stays 0, and the memo declines to cache anything at all — the tree
# behaves exactly as it did before the memo existed. It costs the wall-clock
# win, never a wrong quote.
