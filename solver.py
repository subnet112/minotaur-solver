"""blueguider-uid124 — lean delegate over the reigning champion.

Chassis doctrine (2026-07-18 rebuild, from studying 21 adoptions):
- The champion's engine runs VERBATIM on every order: identical plans,
  identical pace ("byte-parity engine = byte-parity pace"). No pre-engine
  hooks, no live probing, no guarded-call overhead.
- Our ONLY divergence: when the engine returns a structurally-empty plan or
  its self-declared blind guess (metadata solver in {best-effort,
  offline-fallback} or route == last_resort_empty — the lineage's own
  convention), we try zero-RPC covers: exact-key rows from
  bg124_covers.json, then the token-keyed V4 census (james_census.json).
  Fill-only-empty ⇒ can only lift a champion-zero, never regress.
- Every region in this file stays far below the champion floor (~123 AST
  nodes, validator metric): tie-breaks and the factorization axis both
  reward the smaller tree, and losing an adoption we outscored to a
  123-node rival (2026-07-17) is what forced this rewrite.
