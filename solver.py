"""CANARY — snapshot-authority override cover for SN112 (Minotaur DEX-swap).

The champion base sometimes ships an OPTIMISTIC single-hop plan built from a
LIVE-RPC quote (metadata solver='score-aware-router', amountOutMinimum=0). When
the scorer replays that plan on an Anvil fork pinned to the epoch fork_block, the
served route can UNDER-DELIVER / revert -> scored as a DROP (chal=None).

The scorer's Anvil fork uses the SAME block as the MarketSnapshot (snapshot.py
reads slot0().call(block_identifier=block_number)). So a route computed from the
snapshot pools via pool_math.find_best_route is FORK-BLOCK-ACCURATE: it predicts
what Anvil will actually deliver. This solver:

  * keeps the champion's EXISTING empty/blind fill behaviour (as solver_9), and
  * for a SERVED (non-empty, non-blind) plan, decodes the champion's swap route
    from its last interaction and computes THAT route's output ON THE SNAPSHOT.
    If the snapshot says the champion route delivers >= quoted*0.90 the plan is
    HEALTHY and returned UNCHANGED (no override). If the snapshot says it will
    under-deliver badly (< quoted*0.50) or the route can't be decoded/found, we
    replace it with the fork-accurate find_best_route route — but ONLY if that
    route itself clears quoted*0.90.

WEAKLY DOMINANT: we never touch a plan the snapshot says delivers fine, and we
only override with a route the snapshot itself predicts meets the quote. On any
error the champion plan is returned untouched (never crash the miner).

Factored into module-level helpers so no AST region exceeds the champion floor
(<174 nodes). CANARY restriction: override serves single-hop routes only
(len(hops)==1); multi-hop routes fall through to the champion plan.
